# Task Manager
Desktop application for scheduling cases, tasks and events.  
Created as a course project on the subject of programming languages.

# About Project
I have created a Task Manager using C# and WPF.  
Using the MVVM pattern and OOP principles. 

The features that have been included in the application are:
  * adding tasks to the provided lists;
  * creating your own lists for tasks;
  * the ability to search for a task;
  * mark tasks important;
  * the ability to edit a task, add a due date, notes;
  * storing information in a .xml file;
  * adding completed tasks to the list of performed tasks, with the possibility of recovery.
  
# Future Plans
Further implementation of the project is possible. Adding notifications, displaying the due date of tasks et—Å.  
Correction of bugs found while adding new application features.
